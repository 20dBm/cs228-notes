We will go through a review of probability concepts over here.

## Probability distributions

<!-- But what is, exactly, probabilistic modeling? When trying to solve a real-world problem using mathematics, it is very common to define a mathematical model of the world in the form of an equation.
Perhaps the simplest model would be a linear equation of the form

{% math %}
y = \beta^T x,
{% endmath %}

where $$y$$ is an outcome variable that we want to predict, and $$x$$ are known (given) variables that affect the outcome. For example, $$y$$ may be the price of a house, and $$x$$ are a series of factors that affect this price, e.g. the location, the number of bedrooms, the age of the house, etc. We assume that $$y$$ is a linear function of this inputs (parametrized by $$\beta$$). -->


## Conditional probability

## Random variables

<!-- To get a first taste of the of the challenges that lie ahead of us, consider a simple application of probabilistic modeling: spam classification.

Suppose we have a model $$p(y,x_1,...,x_n)$$ of word occurrences in spam and non-spam mail. Each binary variable $$x_i$$ encodes whether the $$i$$-ith English word is present in the email; the binary variable $$Y$$ indicates whether the email is spam. In order to classify a new email, we may look at the probability {%m%} P(y=1 | x_1,...,x_n) {%em%}. -->
