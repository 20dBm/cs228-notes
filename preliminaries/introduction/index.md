Probabilistic graphical modeling is a field of AI that studies how to model real-world phenomena using probability distributions and use these models to make useful predictions about the future.

Building probabilistic models turns out to be a complex and fascinating problem. From a more academic point of view, this field builds on a beautiful theory that bridges two very different fields of mathematics: probability theory --- which, along with statistics, forms the core of modern machine learning and data analysis --- as well as discrete math --- particularly graph theory and combinatorics. The field also has intriguing connections to philosophy, especially the question of causality.

Probabilistic modeling is also deeply grounded in reality and has countless real-world applications in fields as diverse as medicine, language processing, vision, physics, and many others. 
It is very likely that at least half a dozen applications currently running on your computer are using graphical models internally. 

This combination of beautiful theory and powerful applications makes graphical models one of the most fascinating topics in modern artificial intelligence and computer science{% sidenote 1 'Indeed, the 2011 Turing award (concidered to be the "Nobel prize of computer science") was recently awarded to [Judea Pearl](http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/pearl_2658896.cfm) for settling the foundations of probabilistic graphical modeling.'%}.

## Probabilistic modeling

But what is, exactly, probabilistic modeling? When trying to solve a real-world problem using mathematics, it is very common to define a mathematical model of the world in the form of an equation.
Perhaps the simplest model would be a linear equation of the form

{% math %}
y = \beta^T x,
{% endmath %}

where $$y$$ is an outcome variable that we want to predict, and $$x$$ are known (given) variables that affect the outcome. For example, $$y$$ may be the price of a house, and $$x$$ are a series of factors that affect this price, e.g. the location, the number of bedrooms, the age of the house, etc. We assume that $$y$$ is a linear function of this inputs (parametrized by $$\beta$$).

Often, the real world that we are trying to model is very complicated; in particular, it often involves a significant amount of *uncertainty* (e.g., the price of a house has a certain chance of going up if a new subway station opens within a certain distance). It is therefore very natural to deal with this uncertainty by modeling the world in the form a probability distribution{% sidenote 2 'For a more philosophical discussion of why one should use probability theory as opposed to something else, see the [Dutch book argument](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dutch-book/) for probabilism.'%}

{% math %}
p(y,x). 
{% endmath %}

Given such a model, we could ask questions such as  "what is the probability that the price is higher than \$100k in five years?", or "given that the house costs this much, what is the most likely number of bedrooms?" Probabilistic modeling is especially important, because:

- Typically, we cannot perfectly predict the future. We often don't have enough knowledge about the world, and often the world itself is stochastic.
- We need to assess the confidence of our predictions; often, predicting a single value is not enough, we need the system to output its beliefs about what's going on in the world.


In this course we will study principled, mathematically rigorous way of reasoning about uncertainty in the world. We will explore ideas from both probability and graph theory to derive efficient machine learning algorithms. From a more theoretical point of view, we will find answers to basic questions such as

- What is the best model for inferring facts about the future, given my limited dataset and computational resources?
- How do I combine prior knowledge with observed evidence in a principled way to make predictions?
- What are the tradeoff between computation time and the richness of a probabilistic model?
- From a mathematical perspective, what does it mean to say that $$A$$ is the cause of $$B$$?

In addition, we will also see many examples of applying these principled algorithms to accurately predict disease outcomes, parse visual scenes, interpret language, etc.

## The difficulties of probabilistic modeling

To get a first taste of the of the challenges that will be facing us in this course, consider another application of probabilistic modeling: spam classification.

Suppose we have a model $$p(y,x_1,...,x_n)$$ of word occurences in spam and non-spam mail. Each binary variable $$x_i$$ encodes whether the $$i$$-ith English word is present in the email; the binary variable $$Y$$ indicates whether the email is spam. In order to classify a new email, we may look at the probability {%m%} P(y=1 | x_1,...,x_n) {%em%}.

What is the ``size" of the function $$\pt$$ that we just defined? Our model defines a probability in $$[0,1]$$ for each combination of parameters $$Y,X_1,...,X_n$$;  specifying all these probabilities will require us to write down a staggering $$2^{n+1}$$ different values, one for each assignment to our $$n+1$$ binary variables. Since $$n$$ is the size of the English vocabulary, this is clearly impractical from both a computational (how do we store this large list) as well as from a statistical (how do we efficiently estimates all these parameters from limited data) point of view. More generally, our example illustrates one of the main challenges that this course will deal with: probabilities are inherently exponentially-sized objects; the only way in which we can manipulate them is by making simplifying assumptions about their structure.

The main simplifying assumption that we will make in this course is that of *conditional independence* among the variables.
For example, suppose that the English words are all conditionally independent given $$Y$$. In other words, the probabilities of seeing two words are independent given that a message is spam. This is clearly an oversimplification, as the probabilities of the words "pills" and "buy" are clearly correlated; however, for most words (e.g. "muffin" and "lamp") the probabilities will indeed be independent, and our assumption will not significantly degrade the accuracy of the model.

We refer to this particular choice of independencies as the *Naive Bayes* assumption. Given this assumption, we can write the model probability as a product of factors

{% math %} 
P(y,x_1,...,x_n) = p(y) \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|y).
{% endmath %}

Each factor {%m%}p(x_i | y){%em%} can be completely described by a small number of parameters ($$4$$ to be exact). The entire distribution is parametrized by $$O(n)$$ parameters, which we can tractably estimate from data and make predictions.

## Describing probabilities with graphs

Our independence assumption can be conveniently represented in the form of a graph.{% marginfigure 'nb1' 'assets/img/naive-bayes.png' 'Graphical representation of the Naive Bayes spam classification model. We can interpret the directed graph as indicating a story of how the data was generated: first, we a spam/non-spam label was chosen at random; then a subset of $$n$$ possible English words sampled independently and at random.' %}
This representation has the immediate advantage of being easy to understand. It can be interpreted as telling us a story: an email was generated by first choosing at random whether the email is spam or not (indicated by $$y$$), and then by sampling words one at a time. Conversely, if we have a story of how our dataset was generated, we can naturally express it as a graph; then, by a series of simple rules, we can translate a graph into a probability distribution that admits a compact parametrization.

More importantly, we will eventually be interested in asking the model questions (e.g. what is the probability of spam given that I see these words?); answering these questions will require specialized algorithms that will be most naturally defined on the graph describing that probability and will be closely related to various graph algorithms. Also, we will be able to describe independence properties of a probabilistic model in terms of graph-theoretic concepts (e.g. in terms of node connectivity).

This brief discussion is meant to emphasize one take-away points: there is an intimate connection between probability distributions and graphs that will be exploited throughout the course for defining, learning, and working with probabilistic models.

## A bird's eye overview of the course

Our discussion of graphical models will be divided into three major parts: representation (how to specify a model), inference (how to ask the model questions), and learning (how to fit a model to real-world data). These three themes will also be closely linked: to derive efficient inference and learning algorithms, the model will need to be adequately represented; furthermore, learning models will require inference as a subroutine. Thus, it will best to always keep the three tasks in mind, rather than focusing on them in isolation{% sidenote 1 'For a more detailed overview, see this [writeup](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_hicYJxvbiOc1ViZTRxbnhSU1cza1VhOFlhRlRuQQ/edit) by Neal Parikh; this part of the notes is based on it.'%}.

### Representation

How do we express a probability distribution that models some real-world phenomenon? This is not a trivial problem: we have seen that a naive model for classifying spam messages with $$n$$ possible words requires us in general to specify $$O(2^n)$$ parameters. We will address this difficulty with general principles for systematically constructing probabilistic models that capture our intuition about the structure of the problem and that can be stored using a reasonable (i.e. polynomial) amount of free parameters. These recipes will typically involve describing probabilities as graphs; these graphs' properties (e.g. connectivity, tree-width) will provide crucial information about the distribution of interest and the kinds of questions that we will be able to answer.

### Inference 

Given a probabilistic model, how do we obtain answers to relevant questions about the world? Such questions often reduce to querying the marginal or conditional probabilities of certain events of interest. More concretely, we will be typically interested in asking the system two types of questions:

- *Marginal inference*: what is the probability of a given variable in our model after we sum everything else out?
{% math %}
p(x_1) = \sum_{x_2} \sum_{x_2}  \cdots \sum_{x_n} p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n).
{% endmath %}
An example query would be to determine the probability that a random house as more than three bedrooms.

- *Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference* asks for the most likely assignment of variables. For example, we may try to determine the most likely spam message that I will receive as follows:
{% math %}
\max_{x_1, \dots, x_n} p(x_1,...,x_n, y=1)
{% endmath %}

Often our queries will involve evidence (like in the MAP example above), in which case we will fix the assignment of a subset of the variables.

It turns out that inference is a very challenging task. For many probabilities of interest, it will be NP-hard to answer any of these questions. Crucially, whether inference is be tractable will depend on the structure of the graph that describes that probability! If a problem is intractable, we will still be able to obtain useful answers via approximate inference methods. Interestingly, algorithms described in this part of the course will be heavily based on work done in the statistical physics community in the mid-20th century.

### Learning

Our last key task refers to fitting a model to a dataset, which could be for example a large number of labeled examples of spam. By looking at the data, we can infer useful patterns (e.g. which word are found more frequently in spam emails), which we can then use to make predictions about the future. However, we will see that learning and inference are also inherently linked in a more subtle way, since inference will turn out to be a key subroutine that we will repeatedly call within learning algorithm. Also, the topic of learning will feature important connections to the field of computational learning theory --- which deals with questions such as generalization from limited data and overfitting --- as well as to Bayesian statistics, which tells us (among other things) about how to combine prior knowledge and observed evidence in a principled way.
