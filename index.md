{% newthought 'These notes'%} are meant to form a concise introductory course on probabilistic graphical modeling{% sidenote 1 'Probabilistic graphical modeling is a subfield of AI that studies how to model the world with probability distributions and then use these distributions to reason about ones decisions.'%}.
They accompany and are based on the material of [CS228](cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/cs228/index.html), the graphical models course at Stanford University, taught by [Stefano Ermon](cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/).

The notes are written and maintained by [Volodymyr Kuleshov](www.stanford.edu/~kuleshov); contact me with any feedback and feel free to contribute your improvements on [Github](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-notes).
This site is currently under construction, but come back soon as we get more material online.
